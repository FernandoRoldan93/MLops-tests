# MLops-tests
The objective of this repository will be the deployment of a Machine Learning pipeline PoC. The final goal is unclear at the moment, but some aspects I would like to test include Model deployment with AWS Kinesis and Lambda, Model monitoring with grafana + prometheus, workflow orchestation with Apache Airflow / Kubeflow / MLFlow / etc... 

This file will be updated with references to the diferent steps that will be taken once done.
